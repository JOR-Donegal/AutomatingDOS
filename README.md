# Background

Before beginning these notes, you should have already read my documentation on command line interfaces.

Since the first computer was connected to a teletype, generations of programmers and computer administrators have used text commands to manage computer systems. Although this might seem an archaic practice, any modern administrator needs to know how to run commands from the command prompt. In many cases, understanding the command line is a prerequisite for automation.

In addition to being able to run commands, an administrator needs to be able to record them, document them and permanently record their use for the future. In Linux, we call this shell scripting. In DOS and then Windows, we call these batch files.

Until the 1980s, computers were primarily operated via text commands. Two operating systems common since this time are still in use today. MS-DOS (now Windows) and Unix (most commonly, OS X, Linux or BSD). In DOS, we have a command processor. It may be a little more complex under Windows, but in pure DOS we have a programme called COMMAND.COM which interprets many of the basic commands. In Windows, we open a special command window to access the prompt.

In these notes, I assume you know the basic DOS commands for manipulating files and directories. We will examine some basic commands and we will learn how to run batch files in Windows/DOS. For the sake of simplicity, I will refer to the command window as DOS regardless of the operating system we are working in.

In this document, there are several key terms. These will be italicized. You may need to look up these terms to get a full understanding of them. Commands are generally shown in bold.
