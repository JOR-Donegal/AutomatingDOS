# The Command Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI we work with in DOS and Windows has its origins in an operating system called CP/M from the 1970s and from the MS-DOS of the 1980s. The old 16-bit MS-DOS has gone from modern Windows and the contemporary command window is a full 32-bit version of DOS. You can run the command windows by typing **cmd** into the search bar.

The program is C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe

You can run several command windows simultaneously. With all command interpreters, there are a set of basic and built-in commands called the internal commands. When you type **dir** or **cls** you are running routines which are built into **cmd.exe** and these commands can only be run from within the command window.

Anyone can write console programs which can be run separately and there are many of these built into Windows. We refer to these as _external commands_. You can run external commands from the command window, or from the search bar.

Windows classifies file types by using an extension. File names were originally in an 8.3 format and used capital letters only, for example COMMAND.COM.

The last three letters of every filename were the extension and **.bat** is a special kind of file with a list of shell instructions. On more recent versions of the OS, also **.cmd** is used.

There are very many commands available to us in DOS and if you need to find one, type HELP to get a list of all valid commands. Once you find the command you need, type HELP Command to get help on that command.
