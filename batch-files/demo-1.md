# Demo 1

In my first example, I am just establishing that I can create and run a batch file. My examples were run on-campus, with a file share linked to X:\\

Create a directory in your home folder called \BatchFiles and save all the work we do in that directory only. In NotePad++, I entered the following and saved the file as demo1.bat

```
@echo off
cls
dir /w
```
