# Batch Files

Extensions may cause us problem. To run a batch file, it must have the extension .bat or .cmd and this is normally hidden. Open the location where you are going to keep your batch files and click view, then check File name extensions.

You should use a simple editor to create and edit your batch files. Do not use Word or WordPad, they may create hidden and control characters. My preferred choice is Notepad++.

I give examples on the following pages. You should understand every line. They were created for my working environment, edit them so they work in whatever environment you are working in.

Create these batch files and run them to test.
