# Demo 2

All commands which you run will display to the terminal and this can look messy. You can turn off this output by issuing the command **@echo off**

The **@** sign make the command apply to itself as well. We also have a minimum standard to apply headers, dates, etc. When we want to use comments, placing :: at the beginning of a line causes the line to be ignored.

```
:: Demo batch file to show a header and banner
:: By: JOR
:: Initial file: 03JAN18
:: Filename: Demo2.bat

@echo off
cls
title JORâ€™s first proper script
echo "*******************************************"
echo This batch file will do stuff
echo This is for demonstration purposes only.
echo "*******************************************"
```
