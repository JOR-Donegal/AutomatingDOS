# Demo 4

Variables are very useful for making a batch file readable and reusable. You need to be careful as any variables you set will remain set once the batch file is finished. It might be a good idea to use SETLOCAL/ENDLOCAL to prevent this. Also, do not put any spaces between the variable name and the value.

By convention, variables which are local to the script are kept as lower case.\
Variables which are global are upper case.\
We can also do calculations with SET also.

SET /A calculation=2+12/4
