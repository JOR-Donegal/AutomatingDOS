# Deliverables

You will be required to keep a copy of well documented batch files and notes as to why you are using them as well as results of any testing you have done. You may be asked to present these notes as evidence of work completed or as part of a lab book, or a cheat sheet. You may be required to submit this work to GITHUB later in the course as proof of work done.

Check with your lecturer!
